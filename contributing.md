## Code
If you want to add or fix functionality in this library, you can create a pull request. The library follows the
[Rust Guidelines](https://aturon.github.io/) and [Rust API guidelines](https://github.com/brson/rust-api-guidelines) as
much as possible. The code is being tested on both Travis CI and Appveyor. As part of testing,
[rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt) is ran to check if the code follows style guidelines. The
easiest way to prevent these tests from failing is to use `cargo fmt` before a commit.
